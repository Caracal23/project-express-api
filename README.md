# Project Express API

Replace this readme with your own information about your project.

Start by briefly describing the assignment in a sentence or two. Keep it short and to the point.

## The problem

Week 13 project was about creating our first API using Express. I decided to choose the Netflix data because I thought I will have more information to work with. I installed Express List Endpoints and follow JenniÂ´s class recordings as guidance to complete this project.

If I had more time, I would have done the first Advanced Streach Goals, building a "nice" frontend display.
